    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A Caesar salad (also spelled Cesar, César and Cesare) is a green salad of romaine lettuce and croutons dressed with lemon juice (or lime juice), olive oil, eggs, Worcestershire sauce, anchovies, garlic, Dijon mustard, Parmesan and black pepper.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large or 2 small heads of romaine lettuce</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese, shredded or shaved</li>
        <li>Crisp croutons – homemade can be made several days ahead. The recipe below makes enough for 2 salads.</li>
        <li>Caesar salad dressing – homemade is best and here is our favorite store-bought dressing in a pinch</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the homemade croutons. Tear some crusty bread into bite-sized pieces, toss with olive oil, salt and pepper, and bake until crispy.</li>
        <li>Make the Caesar dressing. I usually just make my dressing in a traditional blender since I’m working with whole anchovies, but see other options here for how to make it by hand or with an immersion blender instead.</li>
        <li>Toss the salad. In a large mixing bowl, combine the lettuce, homemade croutons, and Parmesan. Drizzle evenly with your desired amount of dressing, then toss until combined.</li>
        <li>Serve. Then sprinkle each serving with some extra Parmesan and freshly-cracked black pepper and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
